<p>This is another <a href="/category/net/csharp/csharp-60/">post in the series</a> on the new features that are coming in C# 6.0.</p>
<p>This is one of my favourite new features. Have you ever written code like this?</p>
<pre><code>if (line != null && line.Product != null)
{
    total += line.Product.Price * line.Quantity;
}</code></pre>
<p>C# 6.0 introduces the ?. null-conditional operator that short circuits and returns null if anything in the chain is null. This combines really well with the <a href="/2007/08/17/null-coalescing-operator/">null-coalescing operator</a> allowing you to rewrite the above as follows.</p>
<pre><code>total += line?.Product?.Price ?? 0 * line?.Quantity ?? 0;</code></pre>
<p>This also works with indexers,</p>
<pre><code>var firstProduct = OrderLines?[0].Product;	// Will return null if OrderLines is null</code></pre>
<p>It also works with methods. This will be really handy for triggering events. Instead of writing,</p>
<pre><code>if (OrderChanged != null)
{
    OrderChanged(this, EventArgs.Empty);
}</code></pre>
<p>You will now be able to write.</p>
<pre><code>OrderChanged?.Invoke(this, EventArgs.Empty);</code></pre>
