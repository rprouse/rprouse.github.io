<p>Many projects that I work on require me to serialize objects out to the file system and then retrieve them later. When I am serializing out program settings that are loaded in every time the program runs, I tend to use the Settings that come as a part of C# projects. If however the user can load or save settings, documents or projects, then I use the <strong>XmlSerializer</strong> class to save instances of a class out to XML. This allows me to automatically create a new document type based on my data classes and save them out with a few lines of code.</p>
<p>Because I do this so often, I have created a static helper class that has two methods that serialize/deserialize any type to/from an XML file. The two methods are:</p>
<pre><code class="csharp">public static void Serialize&lt;T&gt;( string filename, T data )
{
   TextWriter writer = null;
   try
   {
      writer = new StreamWriter( filename );
      XmlSerializer serializer = new XmlSerializer( typeof(T) );
      serializer.Serialize( writer, data );
   }
   finally
   {
      if ( writer != null )
      {
         writer.Close();
      }
   }
}

public static T Deserialize&lt;T&gt;( string filename )
{
   TextReader reader = null;
   T data = default(T);
   try
   {
      reader = new StreamReader( filename );
      XmlSerializer serializer = new XmlSerializer( typeof(T) );
      data = ( T )serializer.Deserialize( reader );
   }
   finally
   {
      if ( reader != null )
      {
         reader.Close();
      }
   }
   return data;
}</code></pre>

<p>With these two methods, you can serialize a class out to XML or restore a class from XML with one line of code.</p>
<pre><code class="csharp">// Serialize out a person to XML
XmlSerializerHelper.Serialize<Person>( "person.xml", person );

// Deserialize the person from XML
Person person = XmlSerializerHelper.Deserialize&lt;Person&gt;( "person.xml" );</code></pre>
<p>The XmlSerializer class will serialize out/in all public properties and members of the given class. One common error is that the class that you are serializing and all contained classes must have a public constructor that takes no parameters.</p>
<p>The class that you are serializing does not need to be modified, but if you want to control how the XML is serialized out, you can use several attributes.</p>
<p>By default, all properties are serialized out as XML elements. If you want to specify how the elements are serialized out, you can use the <strong>XmlElementAttribute</strong> and set properties on it such as <strong>ElementName</strong>.</p>
<p>Simple types such as string and int can be serialized out as Xml attributes if you prefer. To do this, mark the properties with the <strong>XmlAttributeAttribute</strong>.</p>
<p>If you want properties in your class to not be serialized, use the <strong>XmlIgnoreAttribute</strong>. This will usually be used for properties that are calculated based on the values of other properties.</p>
