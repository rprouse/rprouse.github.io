<p>Do you ever find yourself using <strong>DateTime</strong> to time a section of code?&nbsp; Do you have code like the following?</p>
<pre><code>DateTime start = DateTime.Now;

// Perform a long process
Thread.Sleep( 1968 );

DateTime end = DateTime.Now;
TimeSpan duration = end.Subtract( start );
Console.WriteLine( "This process took {0} ms", duration.TotalMilliseconds );</code></pre>
<p>If you do, you should look at the <strong><a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.diagnostics.stopwatch.aspx">System.Diagnostics.Stopwatch</a></strong> class that was introduced in the 2.0 framework.&nbsp; You can convert the code above to the much more readable</p>
<pre><code>Stopwatch stopwatch = Stopwatch.StartNew();

// Perform a long process
Thread.Sleep( 1968 );

stopwatch.Stop();
Console.WriteLine( "This process took {0} ms", stopwatch.ElapsedMilliseconds );</code></pre>
