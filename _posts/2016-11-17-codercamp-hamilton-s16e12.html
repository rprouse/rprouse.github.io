<p>The next <a href="http://www.codercamphamilton.com/Events/2016/12/14/CoderCamp-S16E12">CoderCamp Hamilton</a> session will be December 14th at 6:30pm upstairs at the Pheasant Plucker, 20 Augusta Street, Hamilton.<!--more--></p>
<p>Rob Porter (<a href="https://twitter.com/rgeraldporter">@rgeraldporter</a>) from <a href="http://weeverapps.com/">Weaver Apps</a> will be speaking about coding and digital solutions to naturalist problems, touching upon improvements on collecting species data in the field, making historical sets of Hamilton species data going<br />
back decades more available, all using some functional <a href="https://www.javascript.com/">JavaScript</a> &amp; <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.js</a> code and maybe even some <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</a>.</p>
<p>Nathan Jervis (<a href="https://twitter.com/mirhagk">@mirhagk</a>) will talk about Visual Studio Team Services (aka Visual Studio Online, aka Team Foundation Server) and how it can be the central location for all the parts of development that aren&trade;t in your editor (source control hosting, issue management, product planning, continuous builds, releases, testing). How it can work with whatever tools you have, mixing and matching the right tools for the right job.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/rprouse">Rob Prouse</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/bpoetz">Bryan Poetz</a> will lead a discussion about the future format of CoderCamp. Bring your ideas about what types of presentations you would like to see and thoughts on changes we can make to the format.</p>
