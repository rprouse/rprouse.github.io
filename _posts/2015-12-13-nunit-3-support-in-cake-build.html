<p><img src="/images/2015/12/cake.png" alt="cake" width="200" height="200" class="alignright size-full wp-image-375" />I've been using <a href="http://cakebuild.net/">Cake Build</a> in a lot of projects lately. Cake is a cross platform build automation system with a C# DSL to do things like compiling code, copy files/folders, running unit tests, compress files and build NuGet packages.</p>
<p>Cake supported running <a href="http://cakebuild.net/dsl/nunit">NUnit 2.x</a>, but as <a href="http://nunit.org/">NUnit 3</a> was a complete rewrite with a new console runner and new command line options, it needed to be updated, so I added the new <a href="http://cakebuild.net/dsl/nunit-v3">NUnit3 build alias</a> to Cake. It is available in Cake v0.6.1 on. It also supports running NUnit 2 tests, so you should consider upgrading all your scripts to use the new alias.</p>
<p>After I created my <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items/rprouse.theme-obsidian">Son of Obsidian theme extension for Visual Studio Code</a>, I documented how to create an extension for the Cake team and they managed to add <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items/cake-build.cake-vscode">Cake support to Visual Studio Code</a> the same day.</p>
<p>If you aren't already using Cake, give it a try.</p>
