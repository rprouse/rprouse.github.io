<p><a href="https://medium.com/s-c-a-l-e/google-systems-guru-explains-why-containers-are-the-future-of-computing-87922af2cf95#.lodtq3bqu" target="_blank">Containers are the future</a>, so I need to be able to work with <a href="https://www.docker.com/" target="_blank">Docker</a>. On Windows, Docker runs inside a virtual machine and by default ships with VirtualBox. As a Windows developer, all of my virtual machines and emulators are Hyper-V images which conflicts with VirtualBox. In the past, I would <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/SwitchEasilyBetweenVirtualBoxAndHyperVWithABCDEditBootEntryInWindows81.aspx" target="_blank">dual boot</a>&nbsp;to switch between Hyper-V and VirtualBox, but that is a huge pain, so I decided to figure out how to get Docker running in Hyper-V. It turns out that it isn't difficult, but most of the instructions assume VirtualBox or are out of date.<!--more--></p>
<h2>Install Docker</h2>
<p>We're all Windows developers here, so I will assume that you are already using Hyper-V and that it is working.</p>
<p>Download <a href="https://www.docker.com/products/docker-toolbox" target="_blank">Docker Toolbox</a> for Windows</p>
<p>Run the installer. On the third screen, you cannot uncheck VirtualBox even though you don't need it. Damn you Docker! No worries, we can get around that...<br />
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-472" src="http://www.alteridem.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/2016-03-08-14_40_06-Setup-Docker-Toolbox.png" alt="Setup - Docker Toolbox" width="499" height="387" /></p>
<p>On the fourth screen, select all options, then continue to click through all of the screens.</p>
<p>At the end of the Docker Toolbox install, it will begin installing VirtualBox. A Windows Security dialog will pop up asking you if you want to install Oracle device software. Clicking <strong>Don't Install</strong> will abort the VirtualBox install.<br />
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-474" src="http://www.alteridem.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/2016-03-08-14_48_08-Windows-Security.png" alt="Windows Security" width="504" height="232" /></p>
<p>The <strong>Docker Quickstart Terminal</strong> and <strong>Kitematic (Alpha)</strong> shortcuts won't work without VirtualBox, so skip them. We will install the Docker vm into Hyper-V manually.</p>
<h2>Create a Boot2Docker Hyper-V Machine</h2>
<p>If you have many virtual machines in Hyper-V, you will likely have several Virtual Switches. You must specify which Virtual Switch to use when you create the Docker VM, so open <strong>Hyper-V Manager</strong> and select <strong>Virtual Switch Manager</strong> from the actions on the right.</p>
<p>Select a Virtual Switch that is connected directly to an external network interface, ideally to an ethernet connection, not to a wireless card. Copy the name of the switch, you will use it when you create the virtual machine.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-476" src="http://www.alteridem.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/2016-03-08-14_59_13-Settings.png" alt="Hyper-V Virtual Switch" width="717" height="372" /></p>
<p>Open an Admin command prompt and run <strong>docker-machine create</strong>, substituting your &nbsp;virtual switch name. In this example, the Hyper-V machine will be called Boot2Docker. See the <a href="https://docs.docker.com/machine/drivers/hyper-v/" target="_blank">Docker Hyper-V documentation</a> for more command line options.</p>
<pre><code>D:\src
&Icirc;&copy; docker-machine create --driver hyperv --hyperv-virtual-switch "Intel(R) Ethernet Connection I217-LM Virtual Switch" Boot2Docker

To see how to connect your Docker Client to the Docker Engine running on this virtual machine, run: C:\Program Files\Docker Toolbox\docker-machine.exe env Boot2Docker
</code></pre>
<p>As this is working, back in Hyper-V Manager, connect to your docker image to see what it is doing.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-481" src="http://www.alteridem.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/2016-03-08-15_17_34-Films-TV.png" alt="Boot2Docker" width="642" height="480" /></p>
<p>I don't like working as an admin if I don't need to, so close your admin command prompt and open a regular command prompt for the remaining work.</p>
<p>That's it, you now have Docker installed and running in Hyper-V. Next up, let's configure the Docker client to connect to your vm.</p>
<h2>Working with docker-machine</h2>
<p>From this point on, everything is standard Docker commands, so check out the <a href="https://docs.docker.com/machine/overview/" target="_blank">docker-machine documentation</a>. Whenever you want to work with Docker, you use <strong>docker-machine</strong> to start and stop your machines, to list running machines and to configure your shell to connect to a running Docker instance.</p>
<h3>Listing Docker Machines</h3>
<p>You use <strong>docker-machine ls</strong> to view registered Docker machines and their state.</p>
<pre><code>D:\src
&Icirc;&raquo; docker-machine ls
NAME          ACTIVE   DRIVER   STATE     URL                        SWARM   DOCKER    ERRORS
Boot2Docker   -        hyperv   Running   tcp://192.168.0.113:2376           v1.10.2
</code></pre>
<h3>Starting and Stopping Machines</h3>
<p>Use <strong>docker-machine start [MachineName]</strong> and <strong>docker-machine stop [MachineName]</strong> to start and stop virtual machines.</p>
<pre><code>&Icirc;&raquo; docker-machine start Boot2Docker
Starting "Boot2Docker"...
(Boot2Docker) Waiting for host to start...
Machine "Boot2Docker" was started.
Waiting for SSH to be available...
Detecting the provisioner...
Started machines may have new IP addresses. You may need to re-run the `docker-machine env` command.
</code></pre>
<h3>Configuring Your Shell</h3>
<p>To connect your Docker client to a running vm, use the command <strong>docker-machine env [MachineName]</strong>.</p>
<pre><code>D:\src
&Icirc;&raquo; docker-machine env Boot2Docker
$Env:DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY = "1"
$Env:DOCKER_HOST = "tcp://192.168.0.113:2376"
$Env:DOCKER_CERT_PATH = "C:\Users\rob.prouse\.docker\machine\machines\Boot2Docker"
$Env:DOCKER_MACHINE_NAME = "Boot2Docker"
# Run this command to configure your shell:
# &amp; "C:\Program Files\Docker Toolbox\docker-machine.exe" env Boot2Docker | Invoke-Expression
</code></pre>
<p>The last line tells you what you need to run to configure your shell. I am using PowerShell, so I need to run <strong>&amp; docker-machine env Boot2Docker | Invoke-Expression</strong> to set the required environment variables.</p>
<h2>Test Your Docker Installation</h2>
<p>Now that you are setup and have your shell configured, run <strong>docker run hello-world</strong> to check that everything is working.</p>
<pre><code>D:\src
&Icirc;&raquo; docker run hello-world
Unable to find image 'hello-world:latest' locally

Hello from Docker.
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
 1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
 2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
 3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
    executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
 4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it
    to your terminal.

To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:
 $ docker run -it ubuntu bash

<p>From here, if you are new to Docker, I would suggest continuing with the <a href="https://docs.docker.com/windows/step_two/" target="_blank">Docker on Windows Getting Started Step 2 - Understanding images &amp; containers</a> which picks up from this point.</p>
