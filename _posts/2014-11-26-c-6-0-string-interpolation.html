<p>This is another <a href="/category/net/csharp/csharp-60/">post in the series</a> on the new features that are coming in C# 6.0.</p>
<p>If you want to try out any of these features now, check out the <a href="https://roslyn.codeplex.com/">Rosyln compiler</a> and then install the <a href="http://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/downloads/visual-studio-2015-downloads-vs">Visual Studio 2015 Preview</a> or fire up a VM in Azure with Visual Studio 2015 Preview already installed.</p>
<p>String interpolation in C# is fairly easy if you only have a couple of arguments, but it can be error prone with many arguments or if you need to re-order the arguments. It is also difficult to quickly see which variable gets substituted in where.</p>
<p>Currently, we write code like this,</p>
<pre><code class="csharp">var msg = string.Format("You ordered {0} {1}{{s}}", line.Quantity, line.Product.Name);</code></pre>
<p>C# 6.0 makes this easier. You can omit the `String.format` and put the variables right in the curly braces. Notice the slash at the start.</p>
<pre><code class="csharp">var msg = "You ordered \{line.Quantity} \{line.Product.Name}{s}";</code></pre>
<p>Notice that pesky improper pluralization though. It was always a pain to deal with. Now, just put the code you need inline.</p>
<pre><code class="csharp">var msg = "You ordered \{line.Quantity} \{line.Product.Name}\{line.Quantity > 1 ? "s" : ""}";</code></pre>
<p>The syntax currently uses a slash before the brace. In a later update, it will be switching to a dollar sign before the first quote and no slash, like this,</p>
<pre><code class="csharp">var msg = $"You ordered {line.Quantity} {line.Product.Name}{s}";</code></pre>
