During my commute to and from work, I listen to a selection of podcasts that help me keep up with new technologies and where .NET development is going. They expose me to new technologies coming out of Microsoft, great open source projects and new ideas in software development.</p>
<p>I have listened to most of the development related podcasts, but over time I have deleted all those that don't deliver regularly or don't teach me new things. I am also biased toward audio only podcasts because I listen to them on my commute.</p>
