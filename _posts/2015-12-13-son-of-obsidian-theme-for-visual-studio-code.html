I'd already created a theme for Visual Studio Code based on Son of Obsidian, so I pulled down <a href="https://github.com/rprouse/theme-obsidian">my theme from GitHub</a> and got to work converting it to an extension. Before the end of the Visual Studio Code announcements, I had my theme converted and uploaded to the new <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items/rprouse.theme-obsidian">Visual Studio Marketplace</a>. I think I was the first extension uploaded to the Marketplace post announcement and my theme is currently the 5th most downloaded.</p>
<p>If you want to install it, in Visual Studio Code, run <code>ext install theme-obsidian</code> or, simply hit <code>CMD/CTRL + Shift + P</code>, search for "Install Extension", and then search for "Obsidian".</p>
