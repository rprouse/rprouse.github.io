<p><strong>New Rule: Make sure your parameter names are consistent between your declarations and definitions in C++.</strong></p>
<p>Here is why...</p>
<p>I was trying to debug some <strong>C++/CLR</strong> code today when I ran into an interesting behavior (bug?) in <strong>Visual Studio 2005</strong>. I had a breakpoint in the first line of my method which I hit fine. I then tried to inspect the value of the two integers that were passed in. The first one showed up fine when I moused over it, but the second one didn't appear. Strange, but I've come to expect that debugging in C++.</p>
<p>The next thing I tried was the Watch window (Ctrl+Alt+W,1). I added both of the parameters. The first showed up fine, but the second said <strong>"error: identifier 'maxRows' out of scope."</strong> How could it be out of scope, I was on the first line in the method?</p>
<p>Next I looked at the Locals window (Ctrl+Alt+V,L). The parameter was showing up fine there! Then I noticed the difference, the name of the parameter in the locals window wasn't pluralized. Sure enough, I looked in the header file and it was spelled <strong>maxRow</strong> there.</p>
<p>It turns out that the debug symbols are taken from the header files, so when you step into a method with parameters that are spelled differently, then you must use the values in the header file to inspect the variables.</p>
<p>Here is an example I mocked up where the parameters were x and y in the header files.</p>

<p>I also tried this in unmanaged C++ and got the same result.</p>
