<p><a href="/assets/img/2008/01/tcc-logosmall.gif"><img style="border: 0px;" alt="tcc-logosmall" src="/assets/img/2008/01/tcc-logosmall-thumb.gif" width="142" height="143" align="right" border="0" /></a> I found out last week that I will be speaking at this year's <a href="http://www.torontocodecamp.net/">Toronto Code Camp</a> on March 1st.&nbsp; I will be giving an <a href="http://www.torontocodecamp.net/Sessions/tabid/55/CodecampId/1/SessionId/16/Default.aspx">Introduction to log4net</a> from 9:00 AM to 10:15 AM.</p>
<p>I will begin the session with an overview of the license, features and capabilities of <a href="http://logging.apache.org/log4net/">log4net</a>, including log levels, log hierarchies, logging contexts, configuration and filters.</p>
<p>I will then dive into code by adding logging to a simple application. Next, I will configure the logging to output the logs to multiple destinations. I will end by discussing best practices for logging with <a href="http://logging.apache.org/log4net/">log4net</a> and answer questions.</p>
