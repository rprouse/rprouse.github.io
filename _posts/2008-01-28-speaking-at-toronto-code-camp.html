  content: Hi, I was wondering if you would be able to post your slides or email them

    Code Camp but I am very interested in using log4net.  Thank you very much !

<p>I will begin the session with an overview of the license, features and capabilities of <a href="http://logging.apache.org/log4net/">log4net</a>, including log levels, log hierarchies, logging contexts, configuration and filters.</p>
<p>I will then dive into code by adding logging to a simple application. Next, I will configure the logging to output the logs to multiple destinations. I will end by discussing best practices for logging with <a href="http://logging.apache.org/log4net/">log4net</a> and answer questions.</p>
