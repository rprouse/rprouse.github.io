<p>Most of the installation instructions for the ruby debugger that I found were out of date for Windows, so I thought it would be useful to document how I got it working. </p>
<ol>
<li>First, you should start with Ruby installed from the <a href="http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/">RubyInstaller</a>. If you have any problems with getting debugging working, I would suggest installing Ruby fresh from here and trying again. </li>
<li>Second, you need to install DevKit. Download DevKit from the <a href="http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/">RubyInstaller</a> page, then follow the installation instructions on the <a href="https://github.com/oneclick/rubyinstaller/wiki/development-kit">Development Kit</a> page. Their instructions are thorough, so I won't reproduce them here. The DevKit install has changed recently and this was part of my problem getting the debugging gem installed. </li>
<li>Install the <strong>ruby-debug-ide19</strong> gem with the following command line.
<pre class="code">gem install ruby-debug-ide19 -platform=ruby</code></pre>
</li>
<li>You should now be able to debug in <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/ruby/">RubyMine</a>. When I started debugging in <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/ruby/">RubyMine</a>, it prompted to install additional debugging gems. I allowed it and they installed fine and debugging started.
<p></li>
<ol type="a">
<li>Set a breakpoint by clicking in the gutter where you want the breakpoint
<p><img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 10px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="breakpoint" border="0" alt="breakpoint" src="/assets/img/2011/01/breakpoint.png" width="186" height="60" /> </li>
<li>Select your run/debug configuration in the toolbar and click on the <strong>Debug</strong> button
<p><img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 10px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="debug" border="0" alt="debug" src="/assets/img/2011/01/debug.png" width="240" height="67" /> </li>
<li>Visit the page you want to debug in your browser. You should hit the breakpoint and see the callstack and the values of all the variables in scope.
<p><a href="/assets/img/2011/01/watch.png"><img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 10px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="watch" border="0" alt="watch" src="/assets/img/2011/01/watch_thumb.png" width="644" height="204" /></a> </li>
<li>You should now be able to step through the code. See the <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/ruby/webhelp/debugging.html">RubyMine debugging documentation</a> for more help. </li>
