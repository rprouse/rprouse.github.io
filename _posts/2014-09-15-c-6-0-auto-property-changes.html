<p>This is the second in a <a href="/category/net/csharp/csharp-60/">series of posts</a> on the new features that are coming in C# 6.0. There have been a few small improvements to Auto-Properties.</p>
<h3>Auto-Property Initializers</h3>
<p>I hinted at this feature in my last post on <a href="/2014/09/08/c-6-0-primary-constructors/">Primary Constructors</a>. Auto-Properties were introduced way back in C# 3.0, but unlike other members, you had to initialize their values in the constructor.</p>
<pre><code>public class Product
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public decimal Price { get; set; }

    public Product()
    {
        Name = "Toy Car";
        Price = 9.99m;
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>In C# 6.0, you can now initialize the properties where they are declared.</p>
<pre><code>public class Product
{
    public string Name { get; set; } = "Toy Car";
    public decimal Price { get; set; } = 9.99m;
}</code></pre>
<h3>Getter Only Auto-Properties</h3>
<p>You could always declare the setter of an auto-property private or protected to prevent it from being used outside of the class.</p>
<pre><code>public decimal Price { get; private set; }</code></pre>
<p>Now you can omit the setter and it makes the underlying field read-only, so you can only set it in the constructor. This is a great feature for creating and enforcing imutable classes.</p>
<pre><code>public class Product
{
    public Product(string name, decimal price)
    {
        Name = name;
        Price = price;
    }

    public string Name { get; }
    public decimal Price { get; }
}</code></pre>
