  content: "I have attended the Code Camp, but could not sit on two seats at once.
    I would like to get familiarized with Log4Net. \r\nUnfortunately, I am stuck with
    MS Power Point 2000. \r\nIs that possible, and perhaps makes sense for other individuals,
    to publish presentations in older version of PP?"

<p>I have been contacted people who cannot attend my <a href="http://www.torontocodecamp.net/">Toronto Code Camp</a> session on <a href="http://www.torontocodecamp.net/Sessions/tabid/55/CodecampId/1/SessionId/16/Default.aspx">log4net</a> tomorrow requesting a copy of my presentation and example code.  I cannot find it posted on the Code Camp site, so here is a copy for anyone who is interested.</p>
<p>The presentation is in PowerPoint 2007 and the example code is for Visual Studio 2008.  <b>update:</b> I have uploaded a PDF version of the presentation for those people without Office 2007.</p>
