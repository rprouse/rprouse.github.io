  content: Thanks a lot!  As Benjy said above, you have to remove the _x86 or _x64
    from the .INF file name before attempting to install.

  content: "Thanks a lot! The comments were very confusing for noobs, the proper way
    of doing it is extracting the file from the zip in the visual studio path assuming
    it is the default if not  you must edit the path by opening the file and editing
    the line which specify the path.\r\nThe most important step is to RENAME the file
    AND REMOVE the (_X86 or_X64) text part!"

<p><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 6px 6px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="CmdPrompt" border="0" alt="CmdPrompt" align="right" src="/images/2010/09/CmdPrompt.png" width="310" height="296" /> Real developers live on the command line. Way back in 1996, Microsoft released the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/downloads/powertoys/xppowertoys.mspx">Command Prompt Here Power Toy</a> to ease their pain. Industrious developers who preferred the Visual Studio command prompt took it and adopted it to run a Visual Studio command prompt with all of the paths to Visual Studio and .NET tools in the path.</p>
<p>In the fine, time honored tradition, I have continued to update with each new Visual Studio release and have finally done so for Visual Studio 2010.</p>
<p>To install, download, unzip and right click and install the INF file, it will add a &acirc;&euro;&oelig;VS 2010 Cmd Prompt Here&acirc;&euro;¬ù menu item when you right click on a folder in Explorer. Clicking on the menu item will launch a DOS prompt in that directory with all of the Visual Studio and .NET paths set correctly.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/images/2010/09/vsnet2010cmdhere_x86.zip">Visual Studio 2010 Command Prompt Here (x86)</a></li>
<li><a href="/images/2010/09/vsnet2010cmdhere_x64.zip">Visual Studio 2010 Command Prompt Here (x64)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>This assumes that you have installed Visual Studio to the default directory on the C drive. If that is not the case, edit the INF file and change line 38 to the correct path for your installation.</p>
