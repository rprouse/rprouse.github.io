<p><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 6px 6px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="CmdPrompt" border="0" alt="CmdPrompt" align="right" src="/images/2010/09/CmdPrompt.png" width="310" height="296" /> Real developers live on the command line. Way back in 1996, Microsoft released the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/downloads/powertoys/xppowertoys.mspx">Command Prompt Here Power Toy</a> to ease their pain. Industrious developers who preferred the Visual Studio command prompt took it and adopted it to run a Visual Studio command prompt with all of the paths to Visual Studio and .NET tools in the path.</p>
<p>In the fine, time honored tradition, I have continued to update with each new Visual Studio release and have finally done so for Visual Studio 2010.</p>
<p>To install, download, unzip and right click and install the INF file, it will add a VS 2010 Cmd Prompt Here menu item when you right click on a folder in Explorer. Clicking on the menu item will launch a DOS prompt in that directory with all of the Visual Studio and .NET paths set correctly.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/images/2010/09/vsnet2010cmdhere_x86.zip">Visual Studio 2010 Command Prompt Here (x86)</a></li>
<li><a href="/images/2010/09/vsnet2010cmdhere_x64.zip">Visual Studio 2010 Command Prompt Here (x64)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>This assumes that you have installed Visual Studio to the default directory on the C drive. If that is not the case, edit the INF file and change line 38 to the correct path for your installation.</p>
