<p>In <a href="http://logging.apache.org/">log4net</a> speak, an appender is an output destination for a log such as a file, the console, a database or even email.&nbsp; <a href="http://logging.apache.org/">log4net</a> ships with so many appenders that most of us will never need to write our own.&nbsp; There are cases where you may find a need for your own appender, for example, you may want to log errors to your company's bug tracking software.&nbsp; </p>
<p>In our case, we simply wanted error logs to pop up a message box with the error and location.&nbsp; We run this internally so that developers run into errors immediately during development and can break into the debugger to fix them.&nbsp; We found that logging to a file was too easy to ignore.</p>
<p><img height="232" alt="MessageBoxAppender" src="/images/2008/01/messageboxappender.jpg" width="484" border="0"> </p>
<p>I was pleasantly surprised how easy it is to write a new appender, but there is very little information on the web, so I thought it would be best to give an example.</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a new Class Library project in Visual Studio.
<li>Add a reference to log4net. My appender also uses MessageBox, so I also added references to System.Drawing and System.Windows.Forms.
<li>Remove the default Class1.cs added to the project.
<li>Add your appender class. In my case, MessageBoxAppender.cs.
<li>You could implement the <a href="http://logging.apache.org/log4net/release/sdk/log4net.Appender.IAppender.html">log4net.Appender.IAppender</a> interface, but it is easiest to derive from <a href="http://logging.apache.org/log4net/release/sdk/log4net.Appender.AppenderSkeleton.html">log4net.Appender.AppenderSkeleton</a>, then most of the work is done for you.
<li>At a minimum, override the <a href="http://logging.apache.org/log4net/release/sdk/log4net.Appender.AppenderSkeleton.Append_overload_2.html">Append</a> method. This is where you do your work.
<li>If you are going to use the <a href="http://logging.apache.org/log4net/release/sdk/log4net.Appender.AppenderSkeleton.RenderLoggingEvent_overload_1.html">RenderLoggingEvent</a> method to create your logging message based on the configured layout (such as PatternLayout), override the <a href="http://logging.apache.org/log4net/release/sdk/log4net.Appender.AppenderSkeleton.RequiresLayout.html">RequiresLayout</a> property and return true.
<li>When you configure your appender, you must give the assembly qualified name for your appender.&nbsp; For example,</li>
</ol>
<p><appender name="..." type="MyNamespace.MyAppender, MyAssembly"></p>
<p>Here is the simplified code for the MessageBoxAppender that I wrote.</p>
<pre><code>using System;
using System.Windows.Forms;
using System.Diagnostics;

using log4net.Core;
using log4net.Appender;

namespace Alteridem.log4net
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Displays a MessageBox for all log messages.
    /// </summary>
    public class MessageBoxAppender : AppenderSkeleton
    {
        /// <summary>
        /// Writes the logging event to a MessageBox
        /// </summary>
        override protected void Append( LoggingEvent loggingEvent )
        {
            string title = string.Format( "{0} {1}",
                loggingEvent.Level.DisplayName,
                loggingEvent.LoggerName );

            string message = string.Format(
                "{0}{1}{1}{2}{1}{1}(Yes to continue, No to debug)",
                RenderLoggingEvent( loggingEvent ),
                Environment.NewLine,
                loggingEvent.LocationInformation.FullInfo );

            DialogResult result = MessageBox.Show( message, title, MessageBoxButtons.YesNo );

            if ( result == DialogResult.No )
            {
                Debugger.Break();
            }
        }

        /// <summary>
        /// This appender requires a <see cref="Layout"/> to be set.
        /// </summary>
        override protected bool RequiresLayout
        {
            get { return true; }
        }
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>There isn't much to see here. I use the log level and the log name in the titlebar. I display the rendered message string and the calling location in the MessageBox and I break into the debugger if you press No.</p>
<p>Now, to configure this for your developers to see ERROR messages, the following configuration would work.</p>
<pre><code><?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
<configuration>
    <configSections>
        <section name="log4net"
        type="log4net.Config.Log4NetConfigurationSectionHandler, log4net" />
    </configSections>
    <log4net>
        <appender name="MessageBoxAppender"
            type="Alertidem.log4net.MessageBoxAppender, log4netExtensions">
            <layout type="log4net.Layout.PatternLayout">
                <ConversionPattern value="%m" />
            </layout>
        </appender>
        <root>
            <level value="ERROR"/>
            <appender-ref ref="MessageBoxAppender" />
        </root>
    </log4net>
</configuration></code></pre>
<p>The only thing to not here is that the log4netExtensions in the appender line is the assembly.</p>
<p>This should be enough to give you a basic framework to build whatever type of appender you want.&nbsp; Every time I delve into a new area of <a href="http://logging.apache.org/log4net/">log4net</a>, I am once again surprised how easy it is to work with and how well designed it is.&nbsp; If you aren't using it, I would highly recommend it.</p>
