  content: "Hello\r\nI've read your post on Alteridem Consulting Website about reading
    properties from an MSI file.\r\nI use GetMsiProperty function to find out MSI
    file version, but I encouraged a problem while trying to delete file after I've
    checked it's version.\r\nIt seems like the file is still in use by GetMsiProperty
    \ function. I tried to find some closing function but I didn't succeed.\r\n\r\nMaybe
    you know something I forgot to do while reading Msi version?\r\n\r\nI would appriciate
    any help."

  content: "Thanks for the code, Robert!\r\n\r\nBut I too encountered the deletion
    problem. A colleague of mine searched and found the (somewhat unintuitive...)
    solution. Before returning from GetMsiProperty, do:\r\n\r\nif (record != null)\r\n{\r\nSystem.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal.FinalReleaseComObject(record);\r\n}\r\nview.Close();\r\nSystem.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal.FinalReleaseComObject(view);\r\nSystem.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal.FinalReleaseComObject(database);"

  content: I was getting an interop exception on the OpenView method when I tried
    this code. I tracked it down to the SQL statement. Removing the single quotes
    from the reference to the Value column and the Properties table fixed the code.

  content: 'didn''t get this to work, although this was a while ago, however here''s
    a more recent link which does the job: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18067598/get-product-version-from-product-code-in-c-sharp/39798277#39798277'
---
<p>Today I was working writing auto-updating for some software. I wanted to base it on the Product Version property in the installer MSI file, so I needed some code to read that from the file.</p>
<p>It took a fair amount of searching and code tweaking, but I finally worked it all out.</p>
<ol>
<li>Add a reference to the COM <strong>Microsoft Windows Installer Object Library</strong>.</li>
<li>Add a <span style="font-family: 'Courier New';"><span style="color: #0000ff;">using</span> WindowsInstaller;</span></li>
<li>Add the following static method to your code (error checking removed for brevity.)</li>
</ol>
<pre class="c-sharp:nogutter">public static string GetMsiProperty( string msiFile, string property )
{
   string retVal = string.Empty;

   // Create an Installer instance
   Type classType = Type.GetTypeFromProgID( WindowsInstaller.Installer );
   Object installerObj = Activator.CreateInstance( classType );
   Installer installer = installerObj as Installer;

   // Open the msi file for reading
   // 0 - Read, 1 - Read/Write
   Database database = installer.OpenDatabase( msiFile, 0 );

   // Fetch the requested property
   string sql = String.Format(
      SELECT Value FROM Property WHERE Property=&trade;{0}&trade;, property );
   View view = database.OpenView( sql );
   view.Execute( null );

   // Read in the fetched record
   Record record = view.Fetch();
   if ( record != null )
      retVal = record.get_StringData( 1 );

   return retVal;
}</code></pre>
<p>If you want to look up the version, just pass in the name of the MSI file you want to inspect and "ProductVersion" for the property you want to return. For example;</p>
<pre class="c-sharp:nogutter"><code>string version = GetMsiProperty( msiFile, ProductVersion );</code></pre>
<p>You can use this method to look up other properties in the installer. Some common ones you might want are <strong>ProductName, ProductCode, UpgradeCode, Manufacturer, ARPHELPLINK, ARPCOMMENTS, ARPCONTACT, ARPURLINFOABOUT</strong> and <strong>ARPURLUDATEINFO</strong>. For a full list of properties, see the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa370905(VS.85).aspx">MSDN Reference</a>, but remember that most of the properties listed on that page are only for already installed applications and won't be included in the installer.</p>
<p>If you find this code useful or the code is not self-explanatory, please leave a comment.</p>
