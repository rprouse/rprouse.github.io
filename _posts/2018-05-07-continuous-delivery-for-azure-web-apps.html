<p>My talk on Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD) to <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-ca/services/app-service/web/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Azure Web Apps</a> that I gave at the <a href="https://global.azurebootcamp.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Global Azure Bootcamp 2018</a>. The talk begins with Right-Click Publish from Visual Studio to an Azure Web App. It then demonstrates automatically deploying updates to the master branch of a <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a> repository. The talk then concludes with by setting up a full build and release CI/CD pipeline using <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/team-services/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Visual Studio Team Services</a> (VSTS).</p>
