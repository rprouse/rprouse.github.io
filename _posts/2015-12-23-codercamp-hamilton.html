<p>The new <a href="http://www.codercamphamilton.com/" target="_blank">CoderCamp Hamilton</a> website went live tonight hopefully signaling a new phase for a great tech get-together in Hamilton.</p>
<p>CoderCamp is a local, monthly mini-conference where local software developers get together to share their experiences with new tools, technologies and techniques. It is a chance to get together with like minded people in a casual setting and talk about our tech passions. It is also a chance to meet other like-minded people in Hamilton and help build a strong tech community.</p>
<p>We meet every month and try to have several presentations lined up, but we are always looking for new people to share their passions with the group. If you would like to give a short, informal presentation to the group, please contact the organizers at <a href="mailto:codercamphamilton@gmail.com/">codercamphamilton@gmail.com</a>.</p>
