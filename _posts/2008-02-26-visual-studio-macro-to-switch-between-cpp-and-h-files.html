    a button you can click to do this, follow these steps:\r\n1) R-click on toolbar,
    select Customize\r\n2) In the Commands tab, under Categories, select Macros then
    the macro you just made (mine was at the top)\r\n3) Drag the name of the macro
    onto the toolbar you want to use (you can make a new one, or add it somewhere)\r\n4)
    R-click on the button you just added (the Customize Window needs to be open) and
    change the name to something shorter (\"CPPH\")"

  content: "Thanks very much! I was looking for this for long. Many times though,
    you store header files in a folder called 'blah/blah/include/file.h' and source
    file in 'blah/blah/source/file.cpp'. So If the file to be opened doesn't exist,
    I try by replacing documentName.replace(\"source\",\"include\") and vice versa
    if that file exists to open. As someone already pointed out, we could directly
    do a File.Exists() to test for it. \r\n\r\nThe only thing remaining now is that
    it is a 'bit' slow (not much, but not negligible also) for me in VS 2005. Does
    anyone know how to make it instantaneous."

  content: I got it why it was slow for me. I always keep a lot of files open in Visual
    Studio, and since the macro goes through all of the open files and activates it
    if it's found, (opens otherwise) it becomes slow. I think there's no need for
    doing this. If you try to 'open' the file when it's already open, Visual Studio
    anyway just activates that. Result, the switching becomes very fast.

<p>I've been doing a lot of managed C++ programming lately and I had forgotten what a pain it is switching back and forth between the header file and source file.&nbsp; Back in the days of Visual Studio 6 I had a macro that switched between the CPP and H file, so I went googling, but the macro I <a href="http://www.codeguru.com/cpp/v-s/devstudio_macros/article.php/c3093/">found</a> didn't work very well in VS2008.&nbsp; Like any good coder, I decided to write it myself instead.</p>
<p>If you haven't written a macro before, here are the steps.</p>
<ol>
<li>In Visual Studio, go to <strong>Tools | Macros | Macros IDE</strong>. A new window should open and in the Project Explorer, the MyMacros project should be open.
<li>Right click on the <em>MyMacros</em> project and select <strong>Add | Add Module</strong>. Name it <em>CppUtilities</em>.&nbsp; The <em>CppUtilities</em> should open in the editor window.
<li>Add the code from below into the module and save the project.</li>
</ol>
<pre name="code" class="vb:nogutter">
&acirc;&euro;&tilde;=====================================================================
&acirc;&euro;&tilde; If the currently open document is a CPP or an H file, attempts to
&acirc;&euro;&tilde; switch between the CPP and the H file.
&acirc;&euro;&tilde;=====================================================================
Public Sub SwitchBetweenSourceAndHeader()
  Dim currentDocument As String
  Dim targetDocument As String

  currentDocument = ActiveDocument.FullName

  If currentDocument.EndsWith(&acirc;&euro;&oelig;.cpp&acirc;&euro;Â, StringComparison.InvariantCultureIgnoreCase) Then
    targetDocument = Left(currentDocument, Len(currentDocument) - 3) + &acirc;&euro;&oelig;h&acirc;&euro;Â
    OpenDocument(targetDocument)
  ElseIf currentDocument.EndsWith(&acirc;&euro;&oelig;.h&acirc;&euro;Â, StringComparison.InvariantCultureIgnoreCase) Then
    targetDocument = Left(currentDocument, Len(currentDocument) - 1) + &acirc;&euro;&oelig;cpp&acirc;&euro;Â
    OpenDocument(targetDocument)
  End If

End Sub

&acirc;&euro;&tilde;=====================================================================
&acirc;&euro;&tilde; Given a document name, attempts to activate it if it is already open,
&acirc;&euro;&tilde; otherwise attempts to open it.
&acirc;&euro;&tilde;=====================================================================
Private Sub OpenDocument(ByRef documentName As String)
  Dim document As EnvDTE.Document
  Dim activatedTarget As Boolean
  activatedTarget = False

  For Each document In Application.Documents
    If document.FullName = documentName And document.Windows.Count > 0 Then
      document.Activate()
      activatedTarget = True
      Exit For
    End If
  Next
  If Not activatedTarget Then
    Application.Documents.Open(documentName, &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Text&acirc;&euro;Â)
  End If
End Sub
</code></pre>
<p>If you switch back to Visual Studio and open the Macro Explorer, you should see the new module <em>CppUtilities</em> and the new macro <em>SwitchBetweenSourceAndHeader</em> in the tree.&nbsp; You could run the macro from here, but it is much easier to bind it to a keystroke.</p>
<ol>
<li>Click on <strong>Tools | Options</strong> then go to the <strong>Environment | Keyboard</strong> tab.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Show commands containing: </strong>box, type <em>CppUtilities.</em> This should filter the list down to one entry, <em>Macros.MyMacros.CppUtilitities.SwitchBetweenSourceAndHeader</em>.</li>
<li>Click on the <strong>Press shortcut keys:</strong> text box and then press the keystroke you would like to use to run the macro. If the keystroke is already used, it will show you below in the <strong>Shortcut currently used by:</strong> dropdown.&nbsp; When you find one that is unused, click the <strong>Assign</strong> button to use it.&nbsp; I use <strong>Ctrl+Shift+Alt+Bkspce</strong>.</li>
<li>Click <strong>OK</strong> then open a CPP or H file and give it a try.</li>
</ol>
