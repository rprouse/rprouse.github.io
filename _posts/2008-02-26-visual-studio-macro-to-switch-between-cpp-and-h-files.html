<p>I've been doing a lot of managed C++ programming lately and I had forgotten what a pain it is switching back and forth between the header file and source file.&nbsp; Back in the days of Visual Studio 6 I had a macro that switched between the CPP and H file, so I went googling, but the macro I <a href="http://www.codeguru.com/cpp/v-s/devstudio_macros/article.php/c3093/">found</a> didn't work very well in VS2008.&nbsp; Like any good coder, I decided to write it myself instead.</p>
<p>If you haven't written a macro before, here are the steps.</p>
<ol>
<li>In Visual Studio, go to <strong>Tools | Macros | Macros IDE</strong>. A new window should open and in the Project Explorer, the MyMacros project should be open.
<li>Right click on the <em>MyMacros</em> project and select <strong>Add | Add Module</strong>. Name it <em>CppUtilities</em>.&nbsp; The <em>CppUtilities</em> should open in the editor window.
<li>Add the code from below into the module and save the project.</li>
</ol>
<pre name="code" class="vb:nogutter">
&tilde;=====================================================================
&tilde; If the currently open document is a CPP or an H file, attempts to
&tilde; switch between the CPP and the H file.
&tilde;=====================================================================
Public Sub SwitchBetweenSourceAndHeader()
  Dim currentDocument As String
  Dim targetDocument As String

  currentDocument = ActiveDocument.FullName

  If currentDocument.EndsWith(.cpp, StringComparison.InvariantCultureIgnoreCase) Then
    targetDocument = Left(currentDocument, Len(currentDocument) - 3) + h
    OpenDocument(targetDocument)
  ElseIf currentDocument.EndsWith(.h, StringComparison.InvariantCultureIgnoreCase) Then
    targetDocument = Left(currentDocument, Len(currentDocument) - 1) + cpp
    OpenDocument(targetDocument)
  End If

End Sub

&tilde;=====================================================================
&tilde; Given a document name, attempts to activate it if it is already open,
&tilde; otherwise attempts to open it.
&tilde;=====================================================================
Private Sub OpenDocument(ByRef documentName As String)
  Dim document As EnvDTE.Document
  Dim activatedTarget As Boolean
  activatedTarget = False

  For Each document In Application.Documents
    If document.FullName = documentName And document.Windows.Count > 0 Then
      document.Activate()
      activatedTarget = True
      Exit For
    End If
  Next
  If Not activatedTarget Then
    Application.Documents.Open(documentName, Text)
  End If
End Sub
</code></pre>
<p>If you switch back to Visual Studio and open the Macro Explorer, you should see the new module <em>CppUtilities</em> and the new macro <em>SwitchBetweenSourceAndHeader</em> in the tree.&nbsp; You could run the macro from here, but it is much easier to bind it to a keystroke.</p>
<ol>
<li>Click on <strong>Tools | Options</strong> then go to the <strong>Environment | Keyboard</strong> tab.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Show commands containing: </strong>box, type <em>CppUtilities.</em> This should filter the list down to one entry, <em>Macros.MyMacros.CppUtilitities.SwitchBetweenSourceAndHeader</em>.</li>
<li>Click on the <strong>Press shortcut keys:</strong> text box and then press the keystroke you would like to use to run the macro. If the keystroke is already used, it will show you below in the <strong>Shortcut currently used by:</strong> dropdown.&nbsp; When you find one that is unused, click the <strong>Assign</strong> button to use it.&nbsp; I use <strong>Ctrl+Shift+Alt+Bkspce</strong>.</li>
<li>Click <strong>OK</strong> then open a CPP or H file and give it a try.</li>
</ol>
