<p>I am developing a <a href="https://xamarin.com/">Xamarin</a> application that displays maps. On Android, the map control requires that <a href="https://developers.google.com/android/guides/overview">Google Play Services</a> is installed, but most emulator images do include them. I mainly develop on Windows, so I have been using the great <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/features/msft-android-emulator-vs.aspx">Visual Studio Emulator for Android</a>. I prefer it because it is fast and uses Hyper-V. Other emulators like <a href="https://xamarin.com/android-player">Xamarin's</a> or <a href="https://www.genymotion.com/">GenyMotion</a>&nbsp;use <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox </a>under the covers which doesn't work if you have Hyper-V enabled and I have had networking problems when it is installed and my laptop resumes from sleep.</p>
<p><a href="https://university.xamarin.com/resources/how-to-install-google-play-on-android-emulator">Xamarin has a great article</a> on how to install Google Play Services on their emulators, but it doesn't work with the Visual Studio Emulator. I then found the <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31550628/visual-studio-emulator-for-android-install-gapps-google-play-services">solution on StackOverflow</a>&nbsp;written&nbsp;Vijay Sargunam. His solution worked perfectly, but was missing a few steps, so the following are my modifications to his work.<!--more--></p>
<ol>
<li>Download the correct GAPPS for the Android version from <a href="http://www.teamandroid.com/gapps/">http://www.teamandroid.com/gapps/</a></li>
<li>Use the Additional Tools (small >> icon) for the emulator and go to the SD Card tab.</li>
<li>Select a folder on your computer to sync with the virtual SD card.</li>
<li><strong>Pull from SD card</strong>, which will create a folder structure on the selected folder.</li>
<li>Now copy the Gapps fill to the 'Download' folder.</li>
<li><strong>Push to SD card</strong>. This will take a little while, and copy the zip file to your emulator.</li>
<li>Run a commmand prompt, and go to <strong>sdk\platform-tools</strong> in your Android SDK location and run <strong>adb devices</strong>.</li>
<li>If you see the your emulator in the list, then skip to step 10.</li>
<li>If you do not see emulator, run the following: <strong>adb connect <emulator ip>:5555</strong> You can find the emulator ip, from within the emulator, go to Settings -> About Phone -> Status and IP section.</li>
<li>Next run, <strong>adb shell</strong>. This will give you a prompt to the android emulator.</li>
<li>Confirm the gapps file is there: <strong>ls /sdcard/Download</strong></li>
<li>Now run,<strong> install_zip.sh /sdcard/Download/<flashablezip>.zip</strong> This should begin the flashing process.</li>
<li>Once the flashing is complete, restart the emulator.</li>
<li>Once you restart, you may see errors with apps like Google+ trying to start up, ignore them for now.</li>
<li>Sign into your Google account and upgrade all apps from Google Play.</li>
<li>When you run your application that requires Google Play services, you may be prompted to upgrade</li>
</ol>
<p>Voil&Atilde;&iexcl;, maps running in the emulator!</p>
