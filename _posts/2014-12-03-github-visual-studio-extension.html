<p>I just released an Alpha release of my Visual Studio extension for working with issues on GitHub.</p>
<p>It allows you to access and manage GitHub issues for repositories that you have commit access to. You can filter and view issues for a repository, edit issues, add comments and close issue. This is the first Alpha release, more features are coming.</p>
<h2>Download</h2>
<p>The easiest way to download is by going to <em>Tools | Extensions</em> in Visual Studio and searching for the GitHub Extension. It is also available in the <a href="https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/e4ba5ebd-bcd5-4e20-8375-bb8cbdd71d7e">Visual Studio Gallery</a> and in the <a href="https://github.com/rprouse/GitHubExtension/releases">GitHub Releases</a> for the project.</p>
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<ul class="task-list">
<li>To view a list of open issues, go to <em>View | Other Windows | GitHub Issue List</em> (Ctrl+W, Ctrl+G)</li>
<li>Log in to GitHub by clicking the logon icon at the upper right of the issue list window</li>
<li>Open the issue window by double clicking an issue in the list, or by going to <em>View | Other Windows | GitHub Issue Window</em> (Ctrl+W, Ctrl+H)</li>
<li>Add a new issue to the selected repository with the + button in the issue list, or from <em>Tools | New Issue on GitHub</em> (Ctrl+W, Ctrl+I)</li>
