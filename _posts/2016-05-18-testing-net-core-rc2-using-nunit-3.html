    Thanks for providing this example. I have recently switched to version 1.0.0-preview2-002973 of .NET Core and after that I can't run my tests any more. The execution fails with the following message:

    Invalid : CMS.Test, Version=1.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null
    Could not load file or assembly 'System.Runtime.InteropServices.PInvoke, Version=4.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b03f5f7f11d50a3a'. Das System kann die angegebene Datei nicht finden.

    The last part is German as I'm running a German version of Windows. The message simply is 'File not found.'. Can you confirm this also happens on your system?

    Thanks.

  content: Andre, I have been sticking with official releases so I have not tried
    002973 yet. I have actually been working pretty hard on getting dotnet-test-nunit
    working so that we have a full test runner for NUnit, so I haven't had time to
    keep up with the .NET Core builds, sorry.

<p><strong>Update:</strong> full <a href="http://www.alteridem.net/2016/06/18/nunit-3-testing-net-core-rc2/">NUnit 3 support for .NET Core and ASP.NET Core has been released</a>.</p>
<p>Things have changed since I wrote <a href="http://www.alteridem.net/2015/11/04/testing-net-core-using-nunit-3/">Testing .NET Core Using NUnit 3</a>, so it is time to update the steps for <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2016/05/16/announcing-net-core-rc2/" target="_blank">.NET Core RC2</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/rprouse/NUnitWithDotNetCoreRC2/tree/nunitlite">code from this post is on GitHub</a> in the nunitlite and test_assembly branches. For those interested in an early peek at the new <strong>dotnet-test-nunit</strong> runner, there is an example on the master branch.<!--more--></p>
<p>Upgrading your project to build on RC2 is a <a href="http://dotnet.github.io/docs/core-concepts/dnx-migration.html" target="_blank">whole</a> <a href="https://docs.asp.net/en/latest/migration/rc1-to-rc2.html" target="_blank">series</a> of <a href="https://wildermuth.com/2016/05/17/Converting-an-ASP-NET-Core-RC1-Project-to-RC2" target="_blank">blog posts</a> in and of itself, so I won't cover it here, but I will remind everyone, "All previous versions of .NET Core and any tooling <strong>must</strong> be removed from the machine in order to properly install and use RC2 release." I uninstalled everything, deleted all directories in Program Files that had DNX or DotNet in their name, deleted the .dnx directory in my user directory and combed through my user and global paths before installing <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/net" target="_blank">.NET Core RC2</a>. I didn't get everything on one machine and was getting strange errors.</p>
<p>So, let's go green field, in Visual Studio, <strong>File | New | Project...</strong> and select <strong>Class Library (.NET Core)</strong> under the new <strong>C# | .NET Core</strong> node.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-540" src="http://www.alteridem.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/2016-05-18-09_55_55-New-Project.png" alt="New .NET Core Project" width="941" height="653" /></p>
<p>This it the code under test. To this, I have added the simple calculator class <a href="http://www.alteridem.net/2015/11/04/testing-net-core-using-nunit-3/">from the last post</a>.</p>
<pre><code>public static class Calculator
{
    public static int Add(int x, int y) => x + y;
    public static int Subtract(int x, int y) => x - y;
    public static int Multiply(int x, int y) => x * y;
    public static int Divide(int x, int y) => x / y;
}
</code></pre>
<p>If you look in <strong>global.json</strong>, the new standard is to put your code in <strong>src</strong> and tests in <strong>test</strong> directories. To conform with this, add a <strong>New Solution Folder</strong> named test.</p>
<pre><code>{
  "projects": [ "src", "test" ],
  "sdk": {
    "version": "1.0.0-preview1-002702"
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>To this new <strong>test</strong> folder, add a new <strong>Console Application (.NET Core)</strong> as your test project and add a reference to the main project.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-545" src="http://www.alteridem.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/2016-05-18-10_36_17-Add-New-Project.png" alt="Add New Console Project" width="941" height="653" /></p>
<p>Now, add the <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/NUnitLite/" target="_blank">NUnitLite NuGet package</a> to the test project and change <strong>Main</strong> in <strong>Program.cs</strong>.</p>
<pre><code>using NUnit.Common;
using NUnitLite;
using System;
using System.Reflection;

namespace NUnitWithDotNetCoreRC2.Test
{
    public class Program
    {
        public static int Main(string[] args)
        {
            return new AutoRun(typeof(Program).GetTypeInfo().Assembly)
                .Execute(args, new ExtendedTextWrapper(Console.Out), Console.In);
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>You can now add your tests to the project.</p>
<pre><code>using NUnit.Framework;

namespace NUnitWithDotNetCoreRC2.Test
{
    [TestFixture]
    public class CalculatorTests
    {
        [TestCase(1, 1, 2)]
        [TestCase(-1, -1, -2)]
        [TestCase(100, 5, 105)]
        public void CanAddNumbers(int x, int y, int expected)
        {
            Assert.That(Calculator.Add(x, y), Is.EqualTo(expected));
        }

        [TestCase(1, 1, 0)]
        [TestCase(-1, -1, 0)]
        [TestCase(100, 5, 95)]
        public void CanSubtract(int x, int y, int expected)
        {
            Assert.That(Calculator.Subtract(x, y), Is.EqualTo(expected));
        }

        [TestCase(1, 1, 1)]
        [TestCase(-1, -1, 1)]
        [TestCase(100, 5, 500)]
        public void CanMultiply(int x, int y, int expected)
        {
            Assert.That(Calculator.Multiply(x, y), Is.EqualTo(expected));
        }

        [TestCase(1, 1, 1)]
        [TestCase(-1, -1, 1)]
        [TestCase(100, 5, 20)]
        public void CanDivide(int x, int y, int expected)
        {
            Assert.That(Calculator.Divide(x, y), Is.EqualTo(expected));
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>You can now set the test project as your startup project and run your tests. If it helps, put a breakpoint in <strong>Main</strong> to see the output.</p>

<p>All in all, for a green field app, then it is pretty straight forward. If you prefer that your tests are in a DLL, then you can follow the steps above, but possibly name the NUnitLite project as a runner and change the AutoRun to get the assembly from a class in your test project. If you prefer this method, I have done it in the <a href="https://github.com/rprouse/NUnitWithDotNetCoreRC2/tree/test_assembly"><strong>test_assembly</strong> branch on GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>I am in the process of upgrading a few RC1 projects, so if I find any other gotchas, I will update. For upgrades, one thing you will have to do is add an imports statement to your project.json to handle the renaming of the targets in RC2. This is done for you if you create a new project, but not if you are upgrading.</p>
<p>For project.json in a console runner;</p>
<pre><code>  "frameworks": {
    "netcoreapp1.0": {
      "imports": "dnxcore50"
    }
</code></pre>
<p>Or in an assembly;</p>
<pre><code>  "frameworks": {
    "netstandard1.5": {
      "imports": "dnxcore50"
    }
</code></pre>
