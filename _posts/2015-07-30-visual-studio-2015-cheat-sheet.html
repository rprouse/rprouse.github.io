I removed the links at the bottom to make more room. There have been several versions of this over the years. Thanks to Phil Price for the version I based this on.</p>
<p>You can download this as an easy to print <a href="/assets/img/2015/07/Visual-Studio-2015-Cheat-Sheet.pdf">PDF</a> or an easy to edit <a href="/assets/img/2015/07/Visual-Studio-2015-Cheat-Sheet.docx">Word document</a>.</p>
<p>If I missed your favorite new shortcut, make sure to let me know in the comments to I can update the cheat sheet.</p>
