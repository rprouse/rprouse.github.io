## Installing Ruby and Jekyll

Do the following if you want to develop using Ruby on your local machine.

1. Install Ruby ([Linux](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/), [Mac](https://gorails.com/setup/osx/10.10-yosemite), [Windows](http://rubyinstaller.org/))
2. If you are on Windows, install [DevKit](http://rubyinstaller.org/add-ons/devkit/)
3. `gem install bundler`

## Building the project

GitHub will do this automatically when you push, but this allows you to view the site locally before you commit.

1. `bundle install`
2. `bundle exec jekyll serve`

## Theme

The theme was created from the [Flexible-Jekyll](https://github.com/artemsheludko/flexible-jekyll) theme.
