My name is Rob Prouse. I am a software&nbsp;developer specializing in .NET, but I am experienced with most popular programming languages. I am passionate about agile engineering practices and present on the subject whenever I get the chance. I manage the [NUnit](https://github.com/nunit) project and have contributed to many open source projects over the years.

You can find my code on [Github](https://github.com/rprouse) and my professional profile on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/robprouse).

I am currently the Chief Technology Officer at [Reliq Health Technologies](https://www.reliqhealth.com/), a global healthcare technology company that specializes in developing innovative solutions for the community care market.

Previously I was a Development Manager with [Bentley Systems](https://www.bentley.com/), the global leader dedicated to providing architects, engineers, geospatial professionals, constructors, and owner-operators with comprehensive software solutions for sustaining infrastructure.

If you want to get in touch, please call (905) 320-7861, or email me at [rob@prouse.org](mailto://rob@prouse.org).
