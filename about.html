I am a software&nbsp;developer specializing in .NET, but I am experienced with most popular programming languages. I am passionate about agile engineering practices and present on the subject whenever I get the chance. I manage the <a href="https://github.com/nunit">NUnit </a>development team and have contributed to&nbsp;many open source projects over the years.</p>
<p>You can find my code on <a href="https://github.com/rprouse">Github</a>&nbsp;or my professional profile on <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/robprouse">LinkedIn</a>.</p>
<p>I am currently an Advisory Software Engineer with <a href="http://www.bentley.com/">Bentley Systems</a>, the&nbsp;<span style="color: #464646;">global leader dedicated to providing architects, engineers, geospatial professionals, constructors, and owner-operators with comprehensive software solutions for sustaining infrastructure.&nbsp;</span></p>
